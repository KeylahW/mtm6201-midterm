        Why did I choose photography?
    </h3>

    <p>
        I chose photography for my website because I enjoy taking pictures of different things. My favorite subjects to photograph are my dogs and plants.<br> I enjoy taking photos of plants because they are easily found everywhere and are interesting to look at. I also enjoy taking photos of my dogs because I think that they<br> would look nice in photos.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many different locations that I enjoy taking photos at.<br>One location that I enjoy to take photos at is my cottage. I like taking pictures there because it is surrounded<br> by a forest and gives me lots of different things to photograph.
